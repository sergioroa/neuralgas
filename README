These are instructions to install NeuralGas on an Ubuntu machine.
Probably this code works also in MacOS (however it has not been tested).
Please let us know if you want a version for Windows or feel free to
provide the appropriate compilation scripts.

Install following packages (Ubuntu 16.04 and higher):
qt5-default

Install the boost dev package. In Ubuntu 16.04 you can install libboost-all-dev

Procedures to install NeuralGas:

Go to the NeuralGas root directory and type the following commands:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ccmake ..

At this point you can provide additional flags to your configuration and type 
the character [c] (configure) twice. If everything worked fine, you can finally 
type [g] for generating the makefile. The final commands are:

$ make
$ sudo make install

Installed programs are:

- NGSuite. Used for testing learning with two different data sets (MackeyGlass and NoisyAutomata) with different learning algorithms.
- LLRGNG. Testing of the Lifelong Robust GNG alg. with a simple distribution of 3 Gaussians.
- GaussianNoise. Testing of the Lifelong Robust GNG alg. with any mixture of Gaussians.
- EBGNG. Testing of a simple Error based GNG alg. with the MackeyGlass data set.
- GNGTesting. Verify the Average Error of some GNG graph given some data.
- VoronoiDiagramm. Generation of a Voronoi diagram as an image, given nodes and data.
- VoronoiWidget. Generation of a Voronoi diagram in a Qt Window, given nodes and data.

Enjoy!
